Role Playing Game

This project was to work with objects and managing their display upon the page.  The user will be given a selection of characters, each with a health rating and attack power.  The selected character will then be put in a section with the remaining characters redisplayed as enemies to attack.  The user will then select a specific enemy who will then be placed in the Enemy slot with the reamining enemies closed up.  The user can then attack the enemy.  With each attack, the player's attack strength increases while the enemy's always stays the same.  If the enemy is defeated, the user can then choose another enemy to attack (with the earned stronger attack power) and continue this until either the player is defeated or all enemies are.  The user can then restart the game.

Techniques used:

* Bootstrap for positioning of items
* Objects to hold each character's name, image, health, base attack, current attack, and their status as being chosen, player, and enemy
* Arrays of objects
* Click methods
* Alteration of CSS to control display
